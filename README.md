# Churn-Prediction

# Predict behavior to retain customers
Context: "Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs."

About the Dataset:
The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription, will be used to develop predictive models. Two datasets are made available here: The churn-80 and churn-20 datasets can be downloaded.

The two sets are from the same batch, but have been split by an 80/20 ratio. As more data is often desirable for developing ML models, let's use the larger set (that is, churn-80) for training and cross-validation purposes, and the smaller set (that is, churn-20) for final testing and model performance evaluation.
